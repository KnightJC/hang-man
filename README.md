# Hangman Game By Jack


## User Experience:

- When the user visits the website they will see a brief view of the main menu screen showing the game. This will show a 'Welcome to Hangman' as well as an ASCII visual art for the start of the game.

- You can start stright away by select the correct letter to play the game. You have 6 attempts as well as a hint of how many letters in the word 
- You will see each incorrect letter entered and you can not guess the same letter again.

- You cannot enter the word but only enter each letter.

- Visual representation of the hangman game.
-If you could not guess the word after 6 tries you can always play again with the 'yes/no' feature

- If you do not want to play anymore then the game will exit from the terminal with a little message

### Improvements:

- There could be a main menu before the game starts with possible instructions and name?
- Bigger variety of words
- Possible animation across the screen to make it more interactive

### PEP8

- I used the PEP8/ CI Python Linter online checker and my python code looks good.
- Errors that was experienced was the actual lines within the ASCII art

### Deployment

- I signed into heroku website where I create a new app
- I named my app "hangmanjck"
- Added two buildpacks to the app, Python (top) and NodeJS (bottom)
- Choose the deployment button and connected my GitHub project to the heroku website
- Enabled autmatic deplots so I can push new code to the deployed website
- After choosing the deployed branch which was created my app
- Link to the site was live: https://hangmanjck-fa5a7ec5d4b9.herokuapp.com/

### Thank you and I hope you enjoy!
